# ICS202 _Data Structures_ - Project

Quad Trees is a critical data structure involved in various fields including image processing and computer graphics. It could be used as an image compression tool especially for images that have big single-colored areas.

In this project we will deal with three main objectives that construct the main transitions from a quad tree to an image and vice versa. Knowing this, the following is each task and the corresponding problem-solving strategies and the faced challenges regarding solving the problem.
